FER - Avdhoot Hirde

Heyy👋👋
So this is the 1st Minor project🧑‍💻🧑‍💻.
Which was ask to present in the 5th Semester of B-tech🎓.

Overview:
This a Deep learning project which is based on Convolutional Neural network for detecting different types of emotion that a human face can show there 7 common types of emotion😃 that this project can detect from facial expression⭐.

The structure of the CNN model in based or inspired by AlexNet with few changes in Hyperparameter and number and sequence of different layers.

Setup:
1. Create a folder in suitable Location on your system
2. creating python virtual environment:
   1. In terminal for folder directory: python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
   2. For windows os in powershell in system base dir: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   3. In the project folder: <venv name>\Scripts\activate.bat

3. pip install requirements.txt


Dataset:
 1. download the FER2013 dataset from Kaggle > https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013
 2. Push the dataset in the project folder and rename it as "dataset"

#Just for running the project you dont need dataset.
#For training the model you need dataset.

Model setup:
  1. Download the git repository in the folder.
  2. Make changes in the "project1.ipynb" file if you want to train the model.
  3. Make changes in "fer.py" file for changing the directory of the saved weights and training of the model.

Operations:
  1. For testing the project RUN: fer.py
  2. For training the model RUN: project1.ipynb

HAPPY CODING🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
